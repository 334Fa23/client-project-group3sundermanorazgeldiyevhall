It is a popular tourist destination and hiking spot, with a steep trail leading to the summit that provides breathtaking views of Waikiki and the Pacific Ocean. The cone was formed over 300,000 years ago and is made of tuff, a type of volcanic ash that has solidified. Diamond Head is named as such because 19th-century British sailors believed they had discovered diamonds on the beach at its base. </p>
            
            <h2>Makapu'u Lighthouse Trail</h2>
            <p>The Makapu'u Lighthouse Trail is a picturesque hike located on the southeastern tip of Oahu in Hawaii. The trail is approximately two miles round-trip and offers stunning views of the ocean and surrounding islands. The highlight of the trail is the Makapu'u Lighthouse, which stands on a scenic cliff 600 feet above sea level and has been guiding ships since 1909. The trail is easy to moderate and suitable for all skill levels, making it a popular destination for families. Additionally, hikers may spot whales and seabirds along the way.</p>
            
            <h2>Arizona Memorial Trail</h2>
            <p>The Arizona Memorial Tour is a unique experience that takes visitors to the USS Arizona Memorial in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The memorial commemorates the lives lost during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Visitors begin at the Pearl Harbor Visitor Center, where they can view exhibits and watch a documentary about the attack. They then board a boat to the memorial, which is built over the sunken remains of the USS Arizona. Visitors can pay their respects to the 1,177 sailors and marines who lost their lives and reflect on the impact of the attack on World War II. </p>
